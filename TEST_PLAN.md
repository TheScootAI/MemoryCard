## Automation Notes for Playwright

When implementing these tests with Playwright MCP:

1. **Use `browser_snapshot`** to capture page state and locate elements by their reference IDs
2. **Use `browser_click`** with proper element references for card clicks
3. **Use `browser_wait_for`** with time parameter for the 1-second mismatch delay
4. **Check text content** in stats displays using snapshots
5. **Verify modal visibility** by checking for "hidden" class or display state
6. **Use `browser_take_screenshot`** to capture visual states for documentation

### Recommended Test Structure:
```
1. Navigate to file:///path/to/index.html
2. Take snapshot to get initial state
3. Interact with elements using their refs from snapshot
4. Wait for animations/timeouts when needed
5. Take new snapshot to verify state changes
6. Assert on text content and element classes
```
