## Bug Report

### Bug #1: Timer Display Not Resetting Immediately

**Severity:** Low (Cosmetic)
**Status:** FIXED ‚úÖ

**Description:**
When clicking "New Game" or "Play Again", the timer display did not update to show "0:00" immediately. It retained the previous game's time value until the first card was clicked, at which point it correctly reset and started from 0:01.

**Root Cause:**
The `startNewGame()` method at game.js:74 reset the `this.seconds = 0` variable but only called `updateStats()`, which updates moves and matches displays. It did not call `updateTimer()` to refresh the timer display.

**Fix Applied:**
Added `this.updateTimer()` call after `this.updateStats()` in the `startNewGame()` method at line 91.

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before:
this.updateStats();

// After:
this.updateStats();
this.updateTimer();
```

**Verification:**
After fix, timer correctly displays "0:00" immediately when:
- Starting a new game
- Clicking "New Game" button
- Clicking "Play Again" after winning
- Changing difficulty level
