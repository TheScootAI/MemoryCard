# Senior Agentic Software Engineer

## Overview

We're seeking a **Senior Agentic Software Engineer** to join our team. This role represents a new paradigm in software development: an engineer who works seamlessly with AI agents (like Claude Code) to design, build, test, and ship complete applications end-to-end.

The ideal candidate demonstrates mastery in **human-AI collaboration**, understanding how to break down complex problems into concrete tasks, communicate intent clearly, and leverage AI agents as force multipliers to accelerate development velocity while maintaining high code quality.

## About the Role

This is not a traditional software engineering role. You will be:
- **Defining and refining requirements** that are crystal clear for AI agents to execute
- **Orchestrating complex multi-step workflows** where agents handle implementation while you validate quality
- **Making strategic architectural decisions** about how systems should be structured for both human and AI maintainability
- **Establishing patterns and standards** that ensure consistency across agent-generated code
- **Reviewing, validating, and improving** agent outputs with a critical eye toward production readiness
- **Creating slash commands and workflows** that standardize how your team uses AI agents

You will write less code yourself but will write *better code* by leveraging AI to handle boilerplate while you focus on design, architecture, and quality.

## Key Responsibilities

### Collaborative Development
- Write clear, detailed specs and prompts that enable AI agents to generate production-quality code
- Break down large features into discrete, agent-executable tasks
- Validate AI-generated code and refactor when necessary
- Establish coding standards and patterns that work well with agent-assisted development

### Architecture & Design
- Design systems that are maintainable by both humans and AI agents
- Make technology stack choices that balance capability with AI-friendliness (prefer vanilla JS, clear patterns over magic)
- Create comprehensive documentation (CLAUDE.md style) that guides AI agents through your codebase
- Establish slash commands and workflows that streamline common development tasks

### Quality Assurance
- Implement automated testing strategies that validate AI-generated functionality
- Review test coverage and results
- Catch edge cases and issues that automated tests might miss
- Ensure code follows established patterns and conventions

### Mentorship & Knowledge Transfer
- Document architectural decisions and implementation patterns
- Help the team understand how to work effectively with AI agents
- Share insights about what works well in agent-human collaboration
- Build institutional knowledge about your tech stack

## Required Skills

### Core Competencies
- **5+ years of professional software engineering experience**
- Strong fundamentals in computer science (data structures, algorithms, design patterns)
- Proven ability to ship production code with high quality standards
- Experience with full-stack development (frontend, backend, deployment)
- Comfortable with version control (git) and modern development workflows

### AI-Agent Collaboration
- Experience working with AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, or similar)
- Demonstrated ability to write clear, unambiguous technical specifications
- Skill at breaking down complex problems into communicable components
- Ability to validate and critique AI-generated work objectively
- Understanding of LLM limitations and how to work within them

### Technical Stack
- **Modern JavaScript/TypeScript** - can architect and review both vanilla and framework-based code
- **HTML/CSS** - can design systems that work across platforms
- **Automated Testing** - Playwright, Jest, or similar frameworks
- **Git workflows** - comfortable with feature branches, pull requests, and commit standards
- **Web fundamentals** - APIs, async patterns, browser APIs, performance optimization

### Soft Skills
- **Communication** - can articulate complex technical concepts clearly
- **Documentation** - enjoys writing clear, maintainable documentation
- **Attention to detail** - catches issues in generated code and test results
- **Collaboration** - works well with both human teams and AI agents
- **Problem-solving** - creative approaches to using AI agents effectively
- **Patience** - understands this is a new way of working and helps teammates learn

## Nice-to-Have Skills

- Experience with Playwright or end-to-end testing frameworks
- Knowledge of Web Audio API or browser APIs
- Experience shipping games or interactive applications
- Familiarity with the Web Animations API
- Understanding of accessibility (WCAG) standards
- Open-source contributions showing collaboration skills

## What Success Looks Like

After 6 months, you will have:

- Shipped 2-3 complete, production-quality applications using agent-assisted development
- Established clear architectural patterns and standards for your team
- Created comprehensive documentation and slash commands that accelerate development
- Trained team members on effective human-AI collaboration workflows
- Built automated test suites that comprehensively validate AI-generated code
- Demonstrated that agent-assisted development can produce code faster AND better than traditional development

## Example Project

A great example of the work you'd do:
- Built a **Memory Card game** from scratch in a single session
- Defined clear requirements and game mechanics (CLAUDE.md)
- Leveraged AI to implement game logic, UI, animations, and sound
- Created comprehensive automated tests (9 test cases, 100% passing)
- Established commit message standards and slash commands
- Generated detailed documentation and test reports
- Result: Production-ready game with excellent code quality, shipped in hours not weeks

## Benefits

- Remote-first: Work from anywhere
- Competitive equity package
- Health, dental, vision, 401k, unlimited PTO
- Learning budget for courses and conferences
- Latest hardware and peripherals of your choice

## How We Work

This role is designed for engineers who are:
- **Eager to learn** - this field evolves rapidly
- **Quality-focused** - willing to review and improve code extensively
- **Documentation-oriented** - see it as core to the job, not a chore
- **Collaborative** - strong at communicating with both AI and humans
- **Strategic** - think about system design holistically

## Interview Process

1. **Initial Call (30 min)** - Chat about AI-assisted development and your experience
2. **Technical Exercise (2-3 hours)** - Build a small feature using Claude Code or similar tool (we provide guidance on prompt engineering)
3. **Code Review (1 hour)** - Review AI-generated code together and discuss your feedback
4. **Architecture Discussion (1 hour)** - Whiteboard session on system design
5. **Cultural Fit (30 min)** - Meet the team and learn about our working style

## Red Flags We're Avoiding

- Engineers who think AI agents will replace them (they won't - you're the director)
- Engineers who can't adapt to new ways of working
- Engineers who prioritize speed over quality
- Engineers who don't document their work
- Engineers who treat testing as optional

## Why You Should Apply

- **Cutting-edge work** - You're pioneering a new way of building software
- **Leverage** - Write 5x more code with better quality by working with AI
- **Learning** - Rapidly develop skills in AI collaboration and system design
- **Impact** - Ship complete products instead of features
- **Career** - This skillset will define the next decade of software engineering

## Apply

Please submit:
- Resume or LinkedIn profile
- GitHub profile (with examples of work or open-source contributions)
- Cover letter: Describe your experience with AI tools and why you're interested in agent-assisted development
- Optional: Link to a project you've built that showcases your architectural thinking
