# Run Automated Tests

Use the Playwright MCP tools to launch the browser, navigate to the game, and run comprehensive automated tests covering:

- Initial game state and UI elements
- Card flipping and matching mechanics
- Non-matching cards flip back behavior
- Game statistics tracking (moves, matches, time)
- Victory condition and modal
- All difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- New Game button functionality
- Play Again button functionality

Take screenshots of each test phase and document results. Compare against TEST_PLAN.md for expected behavior. Report any failures or deviations.

After running tests, provide a summary of:
- Total tests executed
- Passed/Failed count
- Any issues discovered
- Screenshots captured
